
Rock Paper Scissors - Python Game

1. I created this game using basic Python functions, and later expanded it into a Tkinter GUI version.
The functions (Rules, Game) helped keep the logic clean and manageable.

2. I handled user inputs carefully — converting everything to uppercase, checking for valid entries,
and giving clear feedback when something went wrong (like invalid choices).

3. I kept track of points for both the player and computer, updating them after every round.It made the game feel more competitive and fun.

4. For the GUI version, I used ttk to build a simple, interactive interface. It includes:

* A title label

* Radio buttons for the player's hand choice

* A submit button to lock in the choice

* Labels to show the current scores, computer’s move, and round result

* A final label to display the game result

5. I later added images (rock, paper, scissors hands) to make it visually engaging.I learned to use 
the PIL library (ImageTk) to resize and display these in the GUI.

6. The core logic (Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, etc.) stayed the same—I just improved how it was presented and interacted with.

7. I made sure the game could be played repeatedly without the GUI crashing,and that the final scores were shown properly at the end.

8. Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project!It helped me understand how to mix core logic with GUI, 
structure a game, and make it look polished while keeping things simple.
