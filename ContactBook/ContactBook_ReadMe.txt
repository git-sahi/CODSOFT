1. For this Contact Book, I’ve used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to manage contact data and save it in a JSON file. I’ve also built an 
interactive GUI using ttk for user convenience.

2. I’ve included a dummy JSON file with fake contact details just for testing purposes—that's also pushed into this GitHub repo.

3. Classes:

* The Contact class is used to initialize the instance variables: name, contact, email, and address.

* The ContactBook class handles everything else—adding, deleting, updating, searching, saving, and loading contacts based on what the task required.

4. GUI:

* Used radio buttons to let users choose an action.

messagebox and simpledialog are used to display messages and get user input.

* A separate window pops up to show all saved contacts in a neat list.

5. Overall I tried to keep the code clean and easy to read. I went with OOP for better structure, storing data in JSON for ease, 
and overall made sure the program feels user-friendly and simple to use.
